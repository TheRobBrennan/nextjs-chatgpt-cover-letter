```

### Install dependencies

Once you have created your Next.js app, navigate to the appropriate directory and verify you can start your development server:

```sh
% cd nextjs-chatgpt-cover-letter && npm run dev

> nextjs-chatgpt-cover-letter@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

- ready started server on [::]:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
- event compiled client and server successfully in 113 ms (20 modules)
- wait compiling...
- event compiled client and server successfully in 72 ms (20 modules)

```

Let's add our dependencies.

```sh
# openai package is a library provided by OpenAI that allows you to interact with their language models and APIs - https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai
# openai-api package is a specific API client library provided by OpenAI - https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai-api
% npm install openai openai-api

# pdf-lib is a library that enables you to work with PDF files programmatically - https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-lib?activeTab=readme
% npm install pdf-lib

# sweetalert2 is a JavaScript library that provides beautiful and customizable popup dialogs, alerts, and modals - https://www.npmjs.com/package/sweetalert2
% npm install sweetalert2

# file-saver is a library that helps in saving files from the web to the userâ€™s device - https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver
% npm install file-saver

```

All that's left is to verify that your development server runs as expected with `npm run dev` ðŸ¤“

### Build the Cover Letter Writing App

First, let's update [./nextjs-chatgpt-cover-letter/app/page.js](./nextjs-chatgpt-cover-letter/app/page.js) with a basic form for our cover letter generator.

Sign in to your Open AI account and generate a new API key at [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Be sure to copy this value to use it in the next step.

Create `nextjs-chatgpt-cover-letter/app/.env.local` by copying `nextjs-chatgpt-cover-letter/app/.env.local.sample` to `nextjs-chatgpt-cover-letter/app/.env.local` - replacing the environment variables as desired.
